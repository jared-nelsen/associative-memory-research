    "## Computer Programs as Associative Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary form of Associative Memory that we have is a Computer Program. In its simplistic form a program is just a set of instructions that operate on data. When given some input X, a program transforms it through a series of steps into some other data Y. Of course there may be side effects for other results through the form of IO. However, for the purposes of this discussion I would like to formally define a program as a set of instructions that transform data in a deterministic way.\n",

But they also know that this is often very complex, especially given the simplistic computer languages they must often work with to define f(x). It is error prone, difficult, and very time consuming to do this. This is especially true for large scale systems that do complex things."
